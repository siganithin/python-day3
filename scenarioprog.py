# A 3-day tech workshop collected attendee registrations separately for each day. 
# You are given three lists (day1, day2, day3) of 
# email addresses â€” lists may contain duplicates (people registering multiple times) and 
# email case may vary (Upper/Lower).

# Write a Python program that:
# Cleans each day's list (normalizes case, removes duplicates).
# Prints the total number of unique attendees across all days.
# Prints the list of attendees who attended all three days.
# Prints the list of attendees who attended exactly one day.
# Prints pairwise overlap counts (day1 & day2, day2 & day3, day1 & day3).
# Produces a final report with counts and sorted lists for each of the above outputs.
